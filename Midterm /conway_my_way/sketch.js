/*
  New Game: Logic Gate Simulation
  * Sources will send input shots that will be either on or off. 
      * Passing them through NOT gates will cause NOT gates to always glow green
      * Shots turn off when a gate returns a false (turn the shot off)
      * All lead to LEDâ€™s at the end which will flicker some decided color if they receive an on input
